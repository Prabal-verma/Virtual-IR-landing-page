Once the development server is running, you can start developing and customizing the landing page. Open `src/App.js` to begin editing the main components.

## Components

The project is structured with several key components:

- `Header.js`: Contains the navigation bar and company logo.
- `HeroSection.js`: The main banner with a welcome message and call-to-action buttons.
- `Financials.js`: Displays key financial data and charts.
- `News.js`: Lists recent company news and press releases.
- `Contact.js`: Provides contact information and a form for inquiries.

You can find these components in the `src/components` directory.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components. The utility-first approach allows for rapid development and customization. The configuration for Tailwind CSS can be found in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Example of a Tailwind CSS styled component

```jsx
// src/components/HeroSection.js
import React from 'react';

const HeroSection = () => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-600 text-white py-20">
      <div className="container mx-auto text-center">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to Our Investor Relations Page</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mb-8">Stay informed with the latest financial updates and news.</p>
